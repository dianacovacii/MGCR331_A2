        <p>The chart above highlights that properties in the London neighborhoods of Shoreditch, 
            Chelsea, and Westminster experience the quickest sales, while Greenwich shows the 
            longest time on the market, followed closely by Notting Hill. This trend indicates
             that the unique characteristics and demand within each neighborhood 
             significantly impact sales speed. </p>
